# eight_queens

Cuenca coding challenge

## Getting Started

1. determine all possible solutions for a given board size / N where N ≥ 8 (within 10 mins on a laptop). Bonus points for a higher N where N is the size of the board / number of queens

2. allow the user to select the board size through the app

3. save the results somewhere—such as local storage

4. add a screen to show the saved results

5. write unit tests

6. setup Travis CI (or similar) for your public GitHub repo to run the tests automatically
